# GDI Raffle Picker

A simple app to collect names and then select
some raffle winners.

## Background

In our GDIMpls classes, as incentive to filling
out our class survey, we hold a raffle after 
students submit their comments.

Often, it's just a quicky script in jsfiddle,
but as I'm looking for React practice, I figured
I'd do a wee little app for it, utilizing
the `create-react-app` tool.

## Usage

Enter the names, one at a time in the input box,
hitting `Enter` (return key) after each name.

When you have the names entered, click on the `PICK!`
button the number of times for the number of 
raffle winners.
